## Mini Seller Console (React + Tailwind)

**Goal:**  
Build a lightweight console to triage Leads and convert them into Opportunities.  
You can use an AI co-pilot, we encourage dev’s to do so, but what we are assessing on is the **structure and quality**.

---

## Requirements (MVP)

1. **Leads List**
   - Load from a local JSON file.
   - Fields: `id`, `name`, `company`, `email`, `source`, `score`, `status`.
   - Features: search (name/company), filter (status), sort (score desc).

2. **Lead Detail Panel**
   - Click a row to open a slide-over panel.
   - Inline edit status and email (validate email format).
   - Save/cancel actions with basic error handling.

3. **Convert to Opportunity**
   - Button: **Convert Lead**.
   - Create an Opportunity with: `id`, `name`, `stage`, `amount` (optional), `accountName`.
   - Show Opportunities in a simple table.

4. **UX/States**
   - Loading, empty, and simple error states.
   - Handle ~100 leads smoothly.

## Nice-to-Haves (pick 1–2)

- Persist filter/sort in localStorage.  
- Optimistic updates with a rollback on simulated failure.  
- Responsive layout (desktop → mobile).  

---

## Tech Constraints

- React (Vite or CRA) + Tailwind CSS.  
- No backend required; use local JSON and `setTimeout` to simulate latency.
